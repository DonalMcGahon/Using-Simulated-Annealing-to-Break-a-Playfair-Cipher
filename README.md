## *The Playfair Cipher*
The Playfair Cipher is a symmetric polygram substitution cipher invented by the Victorian
scientist Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1854 (of Wheatstone Bridge fame). The cipher is named
after his colleague Lord Playfair, who popularised and promoted the encryption system. Due to
its simplicity, the Playfair Cipher was used at a tactical level by both the British and US forces
during WWII and is also notable for its role in the rescue of the crew of PT-109 in the Pacific
in 1943.
Polygram substitution is a classical system of encryption in which a group of n plain-text letters
is replaced as a unit by n cipher-text letters. In the simplest case, where n = 2, the system is
called digraphic and each letter pair is replaced by a cipher digraph. The Playfair Cipher uses
digraphs to encrypt and decrypt from a 5x5 matrix constructed from a sequence key of 25
unique letters. Note that the letter J is not included.
